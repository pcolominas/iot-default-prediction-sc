# IoT-Powered Risk Modeling for Default Predictions in AgriTech

## Project Overview
This project was part of the Analytics in Action program at Columbia Business School in collaboration with SunCulture, a company providing solar-powered water pumps to farmers in Kenya. The goal was to develop a **default prediction model** using IoT telemetry and payment data to help reduce customer churn and improve financial sustainability.

## Approach
- **Data Processing:** Worked with large-scale IoT data (500M+ records) using KQL for data aggregation.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted key device activity and payment behavior insights.
- **Model Development:** Built a machine learning model to identify high-risk clients and prioritize retention efforts.
- **Business Impact:** Enabled more efficient customer management strategies.
